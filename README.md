UX220 Assignment 1 start
===

Use this as a template to follow the instructions in the lab.

Pretend that you are meeting your classmate in an airport 5 years from now. You have a few minutes for a coffee to catch up. What do you want to be able to tell that classmate that you have accomplished in those first 5 years after leaving school. You will need to use the code from https://github.com/rhildred/UX220Assignment1 as a template. When you have it in your own account you will need to edit it in codespaces.

Pick 4 categories for your goals. Mine were Family, Financial, Recreational and Professional. Put your categories as headings in each of the 4 provided markdown files. In each markdown file in the important things you will want to tell your classmate that you have accomplished. Construct an image to introduce each category and use it in the markdown. You will need to host your image on line somewhere.

When that is complete, edit the markdown files. Go to the library website and do an omni websearch for `student portfolio goals.` Read one or 2 articles that you find. Write a paragraph comparing and contrasting your goals with the academic goals/learning outcomes. Remember to cite the articles that you read.
